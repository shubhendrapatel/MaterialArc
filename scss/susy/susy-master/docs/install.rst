Getting Started
===============

The only requirement is `Sass`_,
but Susy was built to be part of the `Compass`_ ecosystem,
and we recommend pairing with tools like
`Breakpoint`_
and `Vertical Rhythms`_.

Compass is still required for the :doc:`susyone` syntax.

.. _Sass: http://sass-lang.com/
.. _Compass: http://compass-style.org/
.. _Breakpoint: http://breakpoint-sass.com/
.. _Vertical Rhythms: http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/typography/vertical_rhythm/


Simple Install
--------------

.. code-block:: bash

  # command line
  gem install susy


Bundler or Rails
----------------

.. warning:: In order to use Susy 2 with Rails you must update your Gemfile to use sass-rails ~> 5.0.0. This is because Susy 2 requires Sass >= 3.3 whilst Rails 4.1 and below include a version of sass-rails which does not support Sass 3.3.

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Gemfile
  # gem 'sass-rails', '~> 4.0.3'
  gem 'sass-rails', '~> 5.0.0'
  gem 'susy'

  # If you want Compass:
  gem 'compass-rails', '~> 2.0.0'

.. code-block:: ruby

  # config/application.rb
  require 'susy'

.. code-block:: bash

  # command line
  bundle install

.. _Bundler: http://bundler.io/
.. _Rails: http://rubyonrails.org/

If you add Susy to an existing Rails app, follow the steps above, but use bundle update instead of bundle install.

.. code-block:: bash

  # command line
  bundle update


Webpack and npm
---------------

Install using npm:

.. code-block:: bash

    npm install susy sass-loader --save-dev


Make sure you have `sass-loader <https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader>`_ enabled in your `webpack` configuration:

.. code-block:: js

    // webpack.config.js
    loaders: [
      {
        test: /\.scss$/,
        loader: 'style!css!sass'
      }
    ]


Start using Susy:

.. code-block:: sass

    /* app.scss */
    @import "~susy/sass/susy";


Gulp
----

Install susy with npm:

.. code-block:: bash

    npm install susy --save-dev


Add Gulp Task:

.. code-block:: js

    // gulpfile.js
    gulp.task('sass', function() {
      return gulp.src('scss/*.scss')
          .pipe(sass({
              outputStyle: 'compressed',
              includePaths: ['node_modules/susy/sass']
          }).on('error', sass.logError))
          .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/css'));
    });

Start using Susy:

.. code-block:: sass

    /* app.scss */
    @import "susy";

Grunt (and Yeoman)
------------------

You can enable Susy in Grunt by adding a line to your ``Gruntfile.js``.
You will need to add a line to either your Sass task or, if you're using Compass, your Compass task.

To add Susy to the Sass task, edit your Gruntfile.js at the root level of your project
and look for the Sass-related rules. Add ``require: 'susy'`` inside the ``options`` object:

.. code-block:: js

  // Gruntfile.js
  sass: {
    dist: {
      options: {
        style: 'expanded',
        require: 'susy'
      },
      files: {
          'css/style.css': 'scss/style.scss'
      }
    }
  }

Assuming you've already installed Susy,
it will now be added to the project
and will not clash with Yeomans grunt rules.

To add Susy to the Compass task, edit your Gruntfile.js at the root level of your project
and look for the Compass-related rules. Add ``require: 'susy'`` inside the ``options`` object:

.. code-block:: js

  // Gruntfile.js
  compass: {
      options: {
        require: 'susy',
        ...
      }
    }
  }

Again, assuming you've already installed Susy,
it will now be added to the project.


Bower
-----

.. code-block:: bash

  # command line
  bower install susy --save

This will add the Susy repository to your ``bower_components`` directory or
create a ``bower_components`` directory for you.

.. code-block:: scss

  // Import Susy
  @import "bower_components/susy/sass/susy";

You can also import Susyone.

.. code-block:: scss

  // Import Susy
  @import "bower_components/susy/sass/susyone";


Compass
-------

If you want to use Susy with `Compass`_,
start by `installing Compass`_.

Create a new Compass project:

.. code-block:: bash

  # command line
  compass create --using susy <project name>

Alternatively, add Susy to a current project

.. code-block:: bash

  # command line
  compass install susy

.. _Compass: http://compass-style.org/
.. _installing Compass: http://compass-style.org/install/


Manual Start
------------

If you want to copy in the Sass files directly,
and skip any package management,
you can do that too.

- Download the zip file from GitHub.
- Copy the contents of the "sass" folder (feel free to remove everything else).
- Paste the files in your project "sass" folder (whatever you call it).


Version Management
------------------

When you work with bundled gems
across a number of different projects,
managing gem versions can become an issue.

If you are in a Ruby environment, check out `RVM`_.
In a Python environment, we recommend `virtualenv`_
with these `scripts`_ added to your
"postactivate" and "predeactivate" files.

Once you have that in place,
`Bundler`_ can be used in either environment
to manage the actual installation and updating of the gems.

.. _RVM: https://rvm.io/
.. _virtualenv: http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html
.. _scripts: https://gist.github.com/1078601


Quick Start
-----------

Once you have everything installed,
you can import Susy into your Sass files.

.. code-block:: scss

  @import "susy";

The basic Susy layout is composed using two simple mixins:

.. code-block:: scss

  @include container; // establish a layout context
  @include span(<width>); // lay out your elements

For example:

.. code-block:: scss

  body { @include container(80em); }
  nav { @include span(25%); }

If you want to lay your elements out on a grid,
you can use the ``span`` mixin to calculate column widths:

.. code-block:: scss

  nav { @include span(3 of 12); }

But you don't have to do things the Susy way.
We give you direct access to the math,
so you can use it any way you like:

.. code-block:: scss

  main {
    float: left;
    width: span(4);
    margin-left: span(2) + gutter();
    margin-right: gutter();
  }

You can also establish :doc:`global settings <settings>`,
to configure Susy for your specific needs.
Create a ``$susy`` variable,
and add your settings as a map.

.. code-block:: scss

  $susy: (
    columns: 12,  // The number of columns in your grid
    gutters: 1/4, // The size of a gutter in relation to a single column
  );

There are many more settings available
for customizing every aspect of your layout,
but this is just a quick-start guide.
Keep going to get the details.
