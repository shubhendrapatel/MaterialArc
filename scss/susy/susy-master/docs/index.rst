Susy |release|
==============

In a world of agile development and
super-tablet-multi-magic-laptop-phones,
the best layouts can’t be contained
in a single framework or technique.
CSS Libraries are a bloated mess of opinions
about how to do your job.
Why let the table-saw tell you where to put the kitchen?

Your markup, your design, your opinions | *our math*.

.. note::

  These docs are focused on Susy |release|.
  See the :doc:`susyone` documentation
  for help with earlier versions of Susy.

ToDo

These are the features we're working on next:

- Add IE support to new syntax.
- Move SusyOne syntax onto new math/output modules.
- Add padding/margin options to the ``span`` mixin, for simpler output.

We're always happy to hear your ideas as well.
Leave us a note on `GitHub Issues`_,

.. note::

  This isn't neverland,
  and Susy isn't magic.
  We're still talking about web design
  in a world where browsers disagree on implementation,
  standards are not always the standard,
  and your Sass code compiles into Boring Old CSS.

  Don't rely on Susy to solve all your problems —
  the table-saw can't build your house for you.
  If you don't understand what Susy is doing,
  take a look at the output CSS files,
  dig around, and find your own path.
  Nothing here is sacred,
  just a set of tools to help make your life easier.
